# Get Started To Upload With MongoDB!

If you're an enthusiast of Mongo, you'd like to store some photos in it...

Well, what this codes is exactly that!

To get things done (we're here using React on front and NodeJS at back):

# yarn start

After you get to the frontend directory.

# npm run dev

After you open another terminal to the backend directory

## Note

To get the full experience, use your own mongo atlas cluster and database. You'll see where things get stopped.
